## :page_with_curl: Overview

This repository holds a collection of tools and scripts I use to automate, monitor, and manage my homelab infrastructure. The goal is to demonstrate how to integrate and implement various technologies such as:

>- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
>- **ArgoCD** for continuous delivery and GitOps workflows.
>- **Helm** for package management in kubernetes.
>- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring and alerting.

It’s a work-in-progress as I constantly add and improve these tools.
